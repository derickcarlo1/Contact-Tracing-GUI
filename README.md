# Contact Tracing App (GUI) üñ•Ô∏è

## Introduction üì¢
Welcome to the Contact Tracing App by Derick! This simple application is designed to collect and store contact tracing information for individuals, making it easier to track potential contacts in case of an infectious disease outbreak. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input their personal information and search for specific entries.

## Languages Used ‚å®Ô∏è
#### The Contact Tracing App is developed using the following languages and technologies:
- Python: The primary programming language used for the application logic.
- Tkinter: A standard Python library for creating GUI applications.
- Pillow (PIL): A Python Imaging Library for handling images.

## Usage ü§î
The Contact Tracing App can be used in various settings where contact tracing is essential, such as healthcare facilities, workplaces, educational institutions, or public events. It offers the following functionalities:

- Data Collection: Users can input their name, age, gender, contact information, address, travel history, and any symptoms they are experiencing.
- Data Saving: The collected information is saved to a file named contact_tracing.txt for later reference.
- Data Search: Users can search for specific entries by providing a name, and the corresponding information will be displayed.
The application's simplicity and user-friendly interface make it accessible to a wide range of users.
